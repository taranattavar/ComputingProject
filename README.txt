1. Open the run.py and plot.py files.
2. For the run.py file, 
	(a) Enter the number of balls in the num parameter.
	(b) Choose the number of frames.
	(c) To animate plot, enter animate=True, otherwise, enter animate = False.

	Note:
	For animated plot, choose low number of frames (~250), otherwise choose ~5000 frames

3. For the plot.py, simply run the file.

	Note:
	The data for the plot.py file has been found by manualling typing the values of pressure at a given temperature and pre-saved to vel_300.txt
